/*
Decimal to Binary
Given a non-negative integer, return its binary representation as a string.

A binary number uses only the digits 0 and 1 to represent any number. To convert a decimal number to binary, repeatedly divide the number by 2 and record the remainder. Repeat until the number is zero. Read the remainders last recorded to first. For example, to convert 12 to binary:

12 ÷ 2 = 6 remainder 0
6 ÷ 2 = 3 remainder 0
3 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 1
1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1
12 in binary is 1100.

Tests:
Waiting:1. toBinary(5) should return "101".
Waiting:2. toBinary(12) should return "1100".
Waiting:3. toBinary(50) should return "110010".
Waiting:4. toBinary(99) should return "1100011".
